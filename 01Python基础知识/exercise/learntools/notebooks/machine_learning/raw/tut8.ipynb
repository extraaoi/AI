    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "So far you've predicted numeric targets. This type of modeling is called **regression**, hence the \"Regressor\" part of `RandomForestRegressor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common problem you'll see is making a choice between mutually exclusive outcomes. For example, spam detection is predicting whether an email is \"spam\" or \"not spam\" based on the email's content. This type of modeling is called **classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of classification: \n",
    "- **binary** (choosing between two classes) and \n",
    "- **multiclass** (choosing between more than two classes). \n",
    "\n",
    "In general there are different approaches to the two types of classification, but most multiclass models will also work for binary problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's straightforward to build classification models using what you already know about scikit-learn. Instead of `RandomForestRegressor`, you will use `RandomForestClassifier`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of classification with `RandomForestClassifier`, we'll use a dataset of phone features to predict a phone's price range. The targets in the data have values:\n",
    "\n",
    " * 0 (low cost)\n",
    " * 1 (medium cost)\n",
    " * 2 (high cost)\n",
    " * 3 (very high cost)\n",
    " \n",
    "The features are things like\n",
    "\n",
    "* battery_power: Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh\n",
    "* blue: Has bluetooth or not\n",
    "* clock_speed: speed at which microprocessor executes instructions\n",
    "* dual_sim: Has dual sim support or not\n",
    "* fc: Front Camera mega pixels\n",
    "* four_g: Has 4G or not\n",
    "* ....\n",
