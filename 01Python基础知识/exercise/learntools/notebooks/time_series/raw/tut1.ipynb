    "**Forecasting** is perhaps the most common application of machine learning in the real world. Businesses forecast product demand, governments forecast economic and population growth, meteorologists forecast the weather. The understanding of things to come is a pressing need across science, government, and industry (not to mention our personal lives!), and practitioners in these fields are increasingly applying machine learning to address this need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series forecasting is a broad field with a long history. This course focuses on the application of modern machine learning methods to time series data with the goal of producing the most accurate predictions. The lessons in this course were inspired by winning solutions from past Kaggle forecasting competitions but will be applicable whenever accurate forecasts are a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "After finishing this course, you'll know how to:\n",
    "- engineer features to model the major time series components (*trends*, *seasons*, and *cycles*),\n",
    "- visualize time series with many kinds of *time series plots*,\n",
    "- create forecasting *hybrids* that combine the strengths of complementary models, and\n",
    "- adapt machine learning methods to a variety of forecasting tasks.\n",

    "As part of the exercises, you'll get a chance to participate in our [Store Sales - Time Series Forecasting](https://www.kaggle.com/c/29781) Getting Started competition.

(This algorithm is often called *ordinary least squares* since it chooses values that minimize the squared error between the target and the predictions.) The weights are also called *regression coefficients* and the `bias` is also called the *intercept* because it tells you where the graph of this function crosses the y-axis.\n",
